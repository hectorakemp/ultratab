# ultratab
Never lose a tab again!

UltraTab will hopefully be an application for people who run a lot of tabs, external to the browser. It will run a Flutter client, and hopefully an Elixir server daemon, with a SQLite database that persists tab information indefinitely. 

The idea came from speaking to a few PhD candidates, and thinking about their habits of keeping tabs open for months at a time. 

I'm hoping it will have Zotero integration, as well as filtering and sorting on website, date, author, etc.
